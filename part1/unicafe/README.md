## 1.6: unicafe step1
Like most companies, Unicafe collects feedback from its customers. Your task is to implement a web application for collecting customer feedback. There are only three options for feedback: good, neutral, and bad.

The application must display the total number of collected feedback for each category. Your final application could look like this:

Once you refresh the page, the collected feedback is allowed to disappear.

## 1.7: unicafe step2
Expand your application so that it shows more statistics about the gathered feedback: the total number of collected feedback, the average score (good: 1, neutral: 0, bad: -1) and the percentage of positive feedback.
