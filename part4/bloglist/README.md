# Exercises 4.1.-4.2. [LINK to exercises](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part4/structure_of_backend_application_introduction_to_testing#exercises-4-1-4-2)
In the exercises for this part we will be building a blog list application, that allows users to save information about interesting blogs they have stumbled across on the internet. For each listed blog we will save the author, title, url, and amount of upvotes from users of the application.

## 4.1 Blog list, step1
Let's imagine a situation, where you receive an email that contains the following application body:

```javascript
const http = require('http')
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const cors = require('cors')
const mongoose = require('mongoose')

const blogSchema = mongoose.Schema({
  title: String,
  author: String,
  url: String,
  likes: Number
})

const Blog = mongoose.model('Blog', blogSchema)

const mongoUrl = 'mongodb://localhost/bloglist'
mongoose.connect(mongoUrl, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true })

app.use(cors())
app.use(express.json())

app.get('/api/blogs', (request, response) => {
  Blog
    .find({})
    .then(blogs => {
      response.json(blogs)
    })
})

app.post('/api/blogs', (request, response) => {
  const blog = new Blog(request.body)

  blog
    .save()
    .then(result => {
      response.status(201).json(result)
    })
})

const PORT = 3003
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`)
})
```

Turn the application into a functioning npm project.

## 4.2 Blog list, step2
Refactor the application into separate modules as shown earlier in this part of the course material.

# Exercises 4.3.-4.7. [LINK to exercises](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part4/structure_of_backend_application_introduction_to_testing#exercises-4-3-4-7)
Let's create a collection of helper functions that are meant to assist dealing with the blog list. Create the functions into a file called utils/list_helper.js. Write your tests into an appropriately named test file under the tests directory.

## 4.3: helper functions and unit tests, step1
First define a dummy function that receives an array of blog posts as a parameter and always returns the value 1. The contents of the list_helper.js file at this point should be the following:

```javascript
const dummy = (blogs) => {
  // ...
}

module.exports = {
  dummy
}
```

Verify that your test configuration works with the following test:

```javascript
const listHelper = require('../utils/list_helper')

test('dummy returns one', () => {
  const blogs = []

  const result = listHelper.dummy(blogs)
  expect(result).toBe(1)
})
```
